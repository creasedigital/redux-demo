// First Principle of redux - the state is a SINGLE global object - which is available in the redux store and our App is always subscribed to

// Second Principle of redux - the state can only be changed by dispatching an action e.g. BUY_CAKE

// Third Principle of redux - the state can only be transformed by an action writing a pure Reducers i.e. a function that takes in the previous state and action as an input an returns the new state e.g. (prevState, action) => newState

// An action creator is an object that returns an action
